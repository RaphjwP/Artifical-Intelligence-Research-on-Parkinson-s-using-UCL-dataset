# Artifical Intelligence Research on Parkinson's using UCL dataset

Parkinson’s Telemonitoring is an important set of data on Parkinson patients. Analyzing different fields of data on different number of patients for different number of test_time can potentially provide an accurate outlook on total_UPDRS. Total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (total_UDPRS) is a scoring system that rates different parkinsonian sign or symptoms rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4, higher number being more severe. The maximum total of total UPDRS score is 199 signifying the worst disability from Parkinson’s disease crediting the source from movement disorders online library. Based on multitude of features, the machine learning algorithms can possibly help on making medical decisions. Using regression techniques to estimate relationships, the features observed from a patient can show the severity of the disease the person is suffering from.
